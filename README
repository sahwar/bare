Bare Linux
==========

Barely a Linux.

www: http://bare.li
irc: #bare on freenode.net

Philosophy
----------

* Favor minimal applications and libraries.
* Only one package per use-case.
* No translations.
* Stable timed branches only containing security updates and bug fixes.
* Vanilla kernel without initramfs and module support. Different kernel
  config and package per target system.

Usage
-----

First bootstrap from a linux system with the necessary toolchain:

	./mk bootstrap

Then build packages in a native Bare system:

	./mk pkg <package>

The contained rootfs can be entered with:

	./mk enter

To build all unbuilt packages and their dependencies:

	./mk pkg

To rebuild all packages:

	./mk -r pkg

Compatibility
-------------

Bare was successfully bootstrapped from:

* Debian 8.3
* Gentoo 20160211

Environment
-----------

The following environment variables can be overridden from the defaults:

	* MK_NPROC: number of parallel processes to build with
	  (defaults to the number of CPUs).

Legal Information
-----------------

Bare Linux consists of several packages, each with their own license.
These can be inspected under /usr/share/licenses on a live system.

The rest of Bare Linux is released under the ISC License.
