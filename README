Bare Linux
==========

Barely a Linux (http://bare.li)

Philosophy
----------

* Favor minimal applications and libraries.
* Only one package per use-case.
* No translations.
* Stable timed branches only containing security updates and bug fixes.
* Vanilla kernel without initramfs and module support. Different kernel
  config and package per target system.

Usage
-----

To build packages in a native Bare system:

    ./mk <command>

The following environment variables can be overridden from the defaults:

* MK_NPROC: number of parallel processes to build with (defaults to the
  number of CPUs).

Bootstrap
---------

First bootstrap from a linux system with the necessary toolchain:

    ./bootstrap -x <cross-dir> -r <rootfs-dir>

Then enter the new rootfs (requires a kernel with user_namespaces(7)
support):

    ./bootstrap -x <cross-dir> -r <rootfs-dir> -c
